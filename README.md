# bubble-shooter-game
Bubble Shooter is a fun and classic arcade-style game where the player aims and shoots colored bubbles to form groups of three or more of the same color. When matched, the bubbles pop and disappear, earning the player points. The goal is to clear all the bubbles from the screen before they reach the bottom.
